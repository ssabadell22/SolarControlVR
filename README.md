# Solar Control VR: See the True Effects of the Sun based on Location, Date, and Time

## Idea

Light reveals the space. People use Unity to visualize the built environment, and sometimes, the to-be-built environment. And the sun is the most magnificent light of all. It is intense. It brings warmth. And it is at its most beautiful at sunrise and sunset.

The ability to “see” how sunlight will penetrate a space - how it will cast shadows - is a crucial element of architectural design. Architects, in particular, want to know *exactly* how sunlight *reveals* their design.

## Inspirational Quotes

> Architecture is the masterly, correct and magnificent play of masses brought together in light. Our eyes are made to see forms in light; light and shade reveal these forms… - *Le Corbusier*

> All material in nature, the mountains and the streams and the air and we, are made of Light which has been spent, and this crumpled mass called material casts a shadow, and the shadow belongs to Light. *- Louis Kahn*

> More and more, so it seems to me, light is the beautifier of the building. *- Frank Lloyd Wright*

> The history of architecture is the history of the struggle for light. *- Le Corbusier*

> We are born of light. The seasons are felt through light. We only know the world as it is evoked by light. *- Louis Kahn*

## UI in VR

For this project, all of the controls for setting the sun’s parameters are presented as 3D “in game” elements. The user will be able to set all sun parameters while in VR, using hand tracking, and interaction with virtual 3D “controls”. This lets the user immediately experience - immersively - the effects of changes in sunlight throughout the day and year.

## Project Details

Built with Unity 2021.3.22f1, the HDRP rendering pipeline, XR Plugin Management version 4.3.3, and XR Interaction Toolkit 2.3.1
